        The first step is always understanding your needs. We start with an
        initial consultation where we discuss your project, requirements, goals,
        and timeline. This helps us better understand what you're looking for
        and allows us to match you with the most suitable developer from our
        team.

      text: Based on your project needs and our understanding from the initial
        consultation, we connect you with the developer or team that best fits
        your project. Our matching process ensures that the developers’ skill
        set aligns with your project requirements.

      text: Once the matching is complete, we have a kickoff meeting to start the
        project. This meeting will include your team and the assigned
        developer(s) to discuss the project in detail, set expectations, and
        establish lines of communication. We believe in transparency and open
        lines of communication, so we provide regular updates throughout the
        project to keep you informed of progress.

  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
